# Mosaïk Studio

Building the web we want to see 🎨

We create professional website templates that don't compromise on ethics, accessibility, or your freedom.

✨ For developers: Full Vue 3 + TypeScript source code<br>
✨ For agencies: Volume licensing & white-label options<br>
✨ For small businesses: Turnkey solutions in 48h

🌿 Open-source stack (Vue, Strapi, Motion)<br>
🔒 Privacy-respecting (Umami, not Google Analytics)<br>
♿ ADA/WCAG compliant by default<br>
🌍 Your data, your site, your control<br>

Because a professional online presence shouldn't mean selling your soul—or your visitors' data.
